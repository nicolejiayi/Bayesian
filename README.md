## Bayesian in Timeseries - a linear regression model
#### This is a project my team did for my class Time Series Analysis. I was responsible for the R code part and MCMC with Gibbs Sampling part. I spent a whole semester self-taught Bayesian theorem and a bit Bayesian Structural Times Series model, and tried how to combine ARIMA with Bayesian estimation.
